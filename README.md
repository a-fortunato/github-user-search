# Github User Search

This is a simple React Native app using the GitHub API to search for users by username, select one and show their details, repos and followers.

It uses redux to store the data.

To run the code and try it out, either an emulator/simulator or a physical device is needed.

First install the dependencies:

`yarn install`

(if it will be run on iOS remember to go to the `ios` folder and run `pod install`)

Then start the react native client:

`yarn react-native start`

And finally build and start the app either in iOS or android with:

`yarn react-native run-ios`

or

`yarn react-native run-android`
